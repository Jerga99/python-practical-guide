# Objective: Create classes for different geometric shapes where
# specific shapes inherit from a base class Shape.

# Base Shape Class:
# Create a base class Shape with general attributes and methods common to all shapes,
# such as __str__, area and perimeter calculations

# Inheritance for Specific Shapes:
# Implement derived classes Rectangle, Square and Circle that
# inherit from the base class Shape, each defining methods to calculate
# its specific area and perimeter.

# c = Circle(3)
# s = Square(5)
# We need two values for both sides
# r = Rectangle(2, 22)

# shapes: tuple[Shape] = (c,s,r)

# for shape in shapes: print(shape)

# print should ouput:
#   Area of Circle is '...', Perimeter of Circle is: '...'
#   Area of Square is '...', Perimeter of Square is: '...'
#   Area of Rectangle is '...', Perimeter of Rectangle is: '...'
