# 1. Create list of user names, with initial values ['John', 'Peter']
# 2. Create 4 functions - 
#       - add_user -> adds new name to the user list
#       - remove_user -> removes a name from the user list
#       - move_user -> move a user from one position to another in the list
#       - print_users -> print all users in the list

# 3. Create Infinite While Loop
# 4. Inside of the while loop ask user to input 4 options
#       - 'a' -> to add user
#       - 'r' -> to remove user
#       - 'm' -> to move user
#       - 'p' -> to print user list

# 5. After selection a specific option ask user to provide:
#    'name' (if add or remove was selected), and add or remove user
#    'from_idx', 'to_idx' (if move user was select), also display list after operation

# 6. If user inputs 'q' then quit the while loop

# Note: you don't need to implement any safe checks, just focus on functionality
